# CNP12-Nsp15-TAMU g
An [SGC]((https://www.thesgc.org/)) Open Chemistry Networks Project (number 12) devoted to the target SARS-COV-2 Nsp15. 

More details can be found in [wiki](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/CNP12-Nsp15-TAMU/wiki). Our current progress can be found [here](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/CNP12-Nsp15-TAMU/wiki/The-Story-so-Far).

Our collective aim is to find a potent, selective, cell-penetrant, small-molecule inhibitor of Nsp15, an endoribonuclease of SARS-COV-2.

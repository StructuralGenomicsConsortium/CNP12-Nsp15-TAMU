# CNP12-Nsp15-TAMU 
An [SGC]((https://www.thesgc.org/)) Open Chemistry Networks Project (number 12) devoted to the target SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15. 

More details can be found in [wiki](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/CNP12-Nsp15-TAMU/wiki). Our current progress can be found [here](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/CNP12-Nsp15-TAMU/wiki/The-Story-so-Far). Linkage to all the data can be found [here](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/CNP12-Nsp15-TAMU/issues/5)

Our collective aim is to find a potent, selective, cell-penetrant, small-molecule inhibitor of Nsp15, an endoribonuclease of SARS-CoV-2. This will allow us to understand this target and kick-start drug discovery projects around it. The project is run as part of the READDI-AViDD consortium.

You contribute synthetic chemistry and in return the SGC/READDI offers biology. Everything is open, with all content governed by a CC-BY-4.0 licence.

If this sounds interesting, and you agree to the simple [RULES](https://www.thesgc.org/sgc-open-chemistry-networks/terms-of-use), you can get started.

For answers to all the questions you have, go to the [FAQs](https://www.thesgc.org/sgc-open-chemistry-networks/faq).

If you'd like to contact someone to talk about contributing, then write something in an Issue (see the tab above), which is a good way to communicate openly. (Issues describe what currently needs doing and act as a discussion forum - you need a Github account but it's super easy and not spammy. There's also an email address (chemistry@thesgc.org) you can use to ask questions. You can read more about all this in the ["How To" Area](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/Chemistry_TechOps_HowTo/wiki)
